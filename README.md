# InheritanceDemo
A demo to show how inheritance works in C#

A simple base class (Mammal) which is inherited by derived classes (Horse) and (Whale).

The idea is not new - taken from a book on C# published by Microsoft and edited by John Sharp but the contents of the classes and comments are my own.
